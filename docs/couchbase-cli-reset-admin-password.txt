=========================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-reset-admin-password - Resets the Couchbase administrator password


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli reset-admin-password' [--cluster <url>] [--regenerate]
	  [--new-password <password>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command is used to reset the Couchbase administrator password. Note that
there is only one Administrator user and that this user is managed separately
from the local and LDAP users which are managed with the
linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-user-manage[1] command.

In order to change the administrator password this command must be run on the
same server that is part of the cluster. This is required because this command
relies on a the Couchbase localtoken which is used to authenticate with the
server and change the password. This is why no authentication needs to be
specified on the command line when running this command.
