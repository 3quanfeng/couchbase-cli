couchbase-cli-node-init(1)
==========================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-node-init - Initializes a node


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli node-init' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--node-init-data-path <path>]
	  [--node-init-index-path <path>] [--node-init-hostname <hostname>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command initializes a Couchbase server. In particular this command allows
the user to set the servers data path, index path, and hostname. The data and
index paths must be set prior to initializing the cluster or adding this target
server to an existing cluster. The hostname however can be changed after the
server has become part of a cluster.

To get the best performance from Couchbase it is reocmmended that the data and
index paths be set to separate disks.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--node-init-data-path::
	The path to store data files create by the Couchbase data service. Note that
	this path is also where view indexes are written on this server. This flag
	can only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.

--node-init-index-path::
	The path to store files create by the Couchbase index service. This flag can
	only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.

--node-init-hostname::
	Specifies the hostname for this server. The hostname can be set before or
	after a node becomes part of a cluster.

EXAMPLES
--------

To initialize a node and set the index path to /mnt1/indexes and the data path
to /mnt2/data run the following command. Note that this command must be run
before the node becomes part of a cluster.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-delete -c 192.168.1.5 \
	 --node-init-data-path /mnt2/data --node-init-index-path /mnt1/indexes

In the command above we have not yet set the cluster username and password so
we can skip adding these to the command line. If we later initialize the cluster
and want to set the hostname for the cluster then we would run the command
below. Notice that this thime the cluster is initialized so we must include the
username and password.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-delete -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator -p password \
	 --hostname cb1.mydomain.com

We could have alternatively set all three of these options below before we
initialized the cluster. This would have been done with the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-delete -c 192.168.1.5 --hostname cb1.mydomain.com \
	 --node-init-data-path /mnt2/data --node-init-index-path /mnt1/indexes

Again note that we don't need the username and password because in this example
the cluster has not yet been initialized.
